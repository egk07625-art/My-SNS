fix: remove invalid functions config from vercel.json

- Remove functions.runtime setting from vercel.json
- Next.js automatically detects Node.js version from package.json engines
- Fix "Function Runtimes must have a valid version" error on Vercel

The functions configuration was causing deployment errors as Next.js
projects handle runtime configuration automatically through package.json.
